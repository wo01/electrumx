 ChangeLog
===========

.. note:: It is strongly recommended you upgrade to Python 3.7, which
   fixes bugs in asyncio that caused an ever-growing open file count
   and memory consumption whilst serving clients.  Those problems
   should not occur with Python 3.7.


Version 1.9.3 (05 Feb 2019)
===========================

* ignore potential sybil peers
* coin additions / updates: BitcoinCashABC (cculianu), Monacoin (wakiyamap)

Version 1.9.2 (03 Feb 2019)
===========================

* restore protocol version 1.2 and send a warning for old BTC Electrum clients that they
  need to upgrade.  This is an attempt to protect users of old versions of Electrum from
  the ongoing phishing attacks
* increase default MAX_SEND for AuxPow Chains.  Truncate AuxPow for block heights covered
  by a checkpoint.  (jeremyrand)
* coin additions / updates: NMC (jeremyrand), Dash (zebra-lucky), PeerCoin (peerchemist),
  BCH testnet (Mark Lundeberg), Unitus (ChekaZ)
* tighter RPC param checking (ghost43)

Version 1.9.1 (11 Jan 2019)
===========================

* fix `#684`_

Version 1.9.0 (10 Jan 2019)

  NOR (flo071), BitcoinPlus (bushsolo), Myriadcoin (cryptapus), Trezarcoin (ChekaZ),
  Bitcoin Diamond (John Shine),
* close `#554`_, `#653`_, `#655`_

Version 1.7.3  (01 Aug 2018)
============================

* fix `#538`_

Version 1.7.2  (29 Jul 2018)
============================

* require aiorpcX 0.5.9; 0.5.8 didn't work on Python 3.7

Version 1.7.1  (28 Jul 2018)
============================

* switch to aiorpcX 0.5.8 which implements some curio task management
  primitives on top of asyncio that make writing correct async code
  much easier, as well as making it simpler to reason about
* use those primitives to restructure the peer manager, which is now
  fully concurrent again, as well as the block processor and
  controller
* fix `#534`_ introduced in 1.7
* minor coin tweaks (ghost43, cipig)

Version 1.7  (25 Jul 2018)
==========================

* completely overhauled mempool and address notifications
  implementation.  Cleaner and a lot more efficient, especially for
  initial synchronization of the mempool.  Mempool handling is fully
  asynchronous and doesn't hinder client responses or block
  processing.
* peer discovery cleaned up, more work remains
* cleaner shutdown process with clear guarantees
* aiohttp min version requirement raised to 2.0
* onion peers are ignored if no tor proxy is available
* add Motion coin (ocruzv), MinexCoin (joesixpack)

Version 1.6  (19 July 2018)
===========================

* implement :ref:`version 1.4` of the protocol, with benefit for light
  clients, particularly mobile
* implement header proofs and merkle caches
* implement :func:`blockchain.transaction.id_from_pos` (ghost43)
* large refactoring of session and controller classes
* recent blocks are now stored on disk.  When backing up in a reorg
  ElectrumX uses these rather than asking the daemon for the blocks --
  some daemons cannot correctly handle orphaned block requests after
  a reorg.  Fixes `#258`_, `#315`_, `#479`_
* minor fixes: nijel
